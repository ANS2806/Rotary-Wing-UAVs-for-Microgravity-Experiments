# Rotary-Wing-UAVs-for-Microgravity-Experiments
This project explores the potential of rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a platform for conducting reduced-gravity experiments. Traditional platforms such as drop
towers and aircraft parabolic flights are limited by high costs, restricted accessibility, and short durations of reduced-gravity conditions, creating a demand for alternative solutions
[1]. Rotary-wing UAVs offer promising potential for executing parabolic trajectories that can simulate microgravity environments as they are accessible, low-cost and do not need much preparation.

Using the Unity Game Engine, this project will develop a simulation model of a rotarywing UAV designed to follow controlled parabolic flight paths. The model will integrate
physics-based elements, including thrust, drag, and random gust disturbances, to replicate real-world conditions. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller will automate
the flight paths, allowing for quick simulations and data collection. MATLAB analytical tools will further process simulation data, enabling in-depth analysis of position, velocity,
and g-forces to validate microgravity quality. A literature review has been conducted and presented in this report to provide important background to the project.

This project aims to address gaps in the accessibility of reduced-gravity research platforms, contributing simulation tools that can be used to assess the flight paths that
provide highest quality microgravity for the longest durations. The findings will also facilitate the assessment of the feasibility of commercially available UAVs for microgravity
research.
